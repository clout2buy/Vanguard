# Vanguard Elite Engine — Master Report

Continuously updated execution record for the master directive. Every phase
records its commits, intended KPI, before/after canary metrics, regressions,
invalidated results, and unresolved risks. Implementation completion is never
described as competitive certification.

Baseline: commit `4430711` (conversational kernel + streaming + steering),
104 tests, live DeepSeek smoke verified. Pre-registered certificate outcomes:
**none / overall parity / parity with scoped superiority / overall
superiority** — the evidence selects the language afterward.

## Phase ledger

### Phase 0 — Gate Zero infrastructure

- **Intended KPI:** evaluation layers exist with contamination rules; canary
  baseline recorded for all later diffs.
- **Deliverables:** `docs/GATE_ZERO.md` (canary / sealed shadow /
  certification holdout), `scripts/run-canary.ps1` (phase-stamped canary
  results with commit provenance), this report.
- **Canary baseline:** see `gauntlet/results/canary-baseline-*.json`.
- **Commits:** recorded below as they land.

### Phase 1 — Provisional-stream lifecycle

- **Intended KPI:** streaming correctness under failure — no duplicated or
  phantom visible text across retries; honest failure; usage metadata
  preserved; no reasoning leakage. Not expected to move canary pass rate.
- **Implemented:** `StreamObserver` lifecycle
  (`started/delta/reset/committed/failed/usage`) in the HTTP adapter;
  reset-before-retry after visible output; non-SSE JSON fallback when a
  compatible endpoint ignores the stream flag; provider usage capture
  (chat `stream_options.include_usage`, Anthropic `message_start`/
  `message_delta` usage merge, Responses terminal object); public events
  `agent.stream_started/reset/committed/failed` with flush-before-commit
  ordering; TUI reset/failure handling.
- **Adversarial proof:** acceptance tests cover disconnect→retry→exactly-once
  answer, tail-flush-before-commit, reset-discards-buffer, malformed SSE
  honest failure with single notification, mid-stream cancellation without
  commit, and (from the prior phase) reasoning/thinking never reaching
  public deltas.
- **Tests:** 110/110 (up from 104; no existing test weakened).
- **Coding non-regression:** canary run pending (recorded under Phase 0/1
  baseline entry once executed).
- **Unresolved risks:** live SSE retry behavior against real DeepSeek
  disconnections is simulated, not field-observed; usage metadata is captured
  but not yet normalized into scorecards (Phase 3).

### Phase 2 — Long-horizon plan spine

- **Intended KPI:** long-horizon integrity — no completion while contract
  criteria/milestones lack evidence; exact plan state across interruption;
  contract constraints/non-goals durable against compaction. Canary steps and
  completion-claim counts are the trend metrics to watch.
- **Implemented:** expanded `TaskContract` (constraints, non-goals,
  assumptions, risk level, required verification, deliverables) rendered into
  the durable task text; `PlanLedger`/`plan.update` (full-plan revisions with
  journaled history, atomic `plan.json`, proven-requires-evidence,
  dependency validation, 24-milestone bound); kernel gates — mutation refused
  before an initial plan, completion enumerates unproven milestones as a
  completion-evidence rejection; interval re-grounding via journaled
  `runtime.note` entries that land late in context; plan + checkpoint ride
  every request as composite runtime-owned working state.
- **Adversarial proof:** tests cover pre-plan mutation refusal, premature
  completion enumeration, proven-without-evidence rejection, invalidation +
  history reload from disk, interrupted execution resuming exact plan state,
  re-grounding cadence reaching the model, and contract sections surviving
  into the rendered task (which the codecs re-anchor if compaction drops it).
- **Note on scale:** the interruption test simulates the mechanism at ~15
  steps rather than the directive's 200 — the state machine is identical; a
  200-step synthetic journal exercise lands with Phase 3's context work.
- **Canary before/after:** baseline recorded pre-Phase-2 (see caveat below);
  post-Phase-2 canary runs after commit.
- **Provenance caveat:** the baseline canary's `npm run build` may have raced
  early Phase 2 type-only edits in the working tree. Behaviorally it is the
  Phase 1 engine (no plan tool was wired). Rule added going forward: canary
  runs only from committed trees.

## Invalidated results ledger

- **2026-07-13 canary `baseline` run: INVALID as a baseline.** Development
  builds (`npm test` → `tsc`) rewrote `dist/` while the canary was mid-run,
  so later cases executed Phase 2 code while earlier cases executed Phase 1
  code. The run is retained for crash signal only. Remediation: clean
  Phase 1 baseline re-run from a git worktree pinned at `d8c3e9f`; standing
  rule added — canary runs execute from committed trees with no concurrent
  builds. (Historical invalidations remain in `docs/LIVE_RESULTS.md`.)

## Unresolved risks (program level)

- Shadow regression set not yet authored (scheduled at Phase 6 milestone).
- Certification holdout untouched by design; evaluator harness (outside
  Vanguard's runtime) not yet built (Phase 13).
- Canary layer runs on live DeepSeek and spends real credits; runs are
  logged with commit provenance.
